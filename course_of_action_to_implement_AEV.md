# **How to Make an Autonomous EV Like Tesla or BYD: Open Source Guide**

---

## **User:**  
If I want to make an autonomous EV like Tesla or BYD is there a GitHub repository for it?

---

## **ChatGPT:**  
Great question! Building an autonomous electric vehicle (EV) like Tesla or BYD is a massive undertaking, but **open-source projects** can help you get started, especially for the software side (autonomous driving, perception, planning, etc.). While you won’t find a single GitHub repository that gives you a “turnkey Tesla,” there **are several open-source projects and repositories** that cover different aspects of autonomous driving and EV control.

### 1. **OpenPilot by Comma.ai**
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/commaai/openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot)
- **Description:** OpenPilot is one of the most advanced open-source driving agents. It can control steering, acceleration, and braking on supported cars. It’s not a full self-driving system like Tesla FSD, but it’s a great starting point for Level 2/3 autonomy.
- **Community:** Large, active, and supports many car models.

### 2. **Apollo by Baidu**
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo)
- **Description:** Apollo is a full-stack open-source autonomous driving platform. It’s much more complex and closer to what big companies use for research and development.
- **Features:** Perception, planning, control, localization, simulation, etc.

### 3. **Autoware**
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/Autoware-AI/autoware.ai](https://github.com/Autoware-AI/autoware.ai)
- **Description:** Autoware is an open-source software stack for autonomous vehicles, especially popular in research and robotics.
- **Features:** Sensor fusion, localization, object detection, path planning, etc.

### 4. **EV Control and BMS (Battery Management System)**
- For the **EV hardware and control side**, there are open-source projects for battery management, motor controllers, and vehicle control units, but these are more fragmented.
- **Example:** [Open Vehicle Monitoring System (OVMS)](https://github.com/openvehicles/Open-Vehicle-Monitoring-System)
- **Example:** [OpenInverter](https://github.com/jsphuebner/STM32-Open-Inverter) (for motor control)

## **User:**  
What is the difference between the full car or prototype? Define it.

---

## **ChatGPT:**  
**Full Car:**  
A **full car** refers to a **complete, production-ready vehicle** that is fully functional, meets all safety and regulatory standards, and is suitable for use on public roads.

**Prototype:**  
A **prototype** is an **early version or experimental model** of a vehicle (or any product) built to test concepts, features, or technologies. Prototypes are **not production-ready** and are usually used for research, development, and demonstration.

| Aspect         | Full Car                        | Prototype                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Purpose        | Consumer use, mass production  | Testing, development, demonstration|
| Features       | Complete, all systems integrated| Partial, experimental, or new tech |
| Safety         | Meets all standards            | May lack full safety features      |
| Legal Status   | Road-legal                     | Usually not road-legal             |
| Production     | Mass-produced                  | One-off or small batch             |
| Example        | Tesla Model 3                  | Test vehicle with sensors/laptop   |

## **User:**  
I have an electric buggy which I need to make fully autonomous and production ready.

---

## **ChatGPT:**  
Here’s a **step-by-step overview** of what it takes to turn your electric buggy into a **fully autonomous, production-ready vehicle**:

### **Prototype Phase**
- **Hardware Integration:** Install cameras, LiDAR, radar, GPS, IMU, etc.
- **Compute:** Add a powerful onboard computer (NVIDIA Jetson, Intel NUC, etc.).
- **Actuators:** Ensure you can control steering, throttle, and brakes electronically (drive-by-wire).
- **Software Stack:** Use open-source stacks like Apollo, Autoware, or OpenPilot.
- **Testing:** Test in a safe, private area.

### **Production-Ready Phase**
- **Safety & Reliability:** Add backup systems, fail-safe mechanisms, and conduct extensive testing.
- **Compliance & Certification:** Meet local/national vehicle safety standards.
- **Manufacturing:** Ensure quality control and reliable sourcing of parts.
- **User Experience:** Develop easy-to-use controls and ensure comfort.

## **User:**  
Please read the Github repos you provided which will give the cars full autonomy and accordingly provide a step by step guide.

---

## **ChatGPT:**  
Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to making your electric buggy fully autonomous using open-source GitHub repositories like **Apollo** and **Autoware**:

1. **Assess Your Buggy’s Hardware**
2. **Choose Your Software Stack** (Apollo or Autoware)
3. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
4. **Integrate Your Sensors**
5. **Vehicle Interface (Drive-by-Wire Integration)**
6. **Map Your Test Area**
7. **Run the Autonomy Stack**
8. **Test in Simulation**
9. **Real-World Testing (Closed Area Only!)**
10. **Move Toward Production-Readiness**

## **User:**  
"You need:

1)Drive-by-wire capability: Electronic control of steering, throttle, and brakes.
2)Powerful onboard computer: (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson, Intel NUC, or a high-end PC)
3)Sensors: At minimum, cameras, GPS, IMU; ideally, add LiDAR and radar for robust autonomy.
4)CAN bus access: For communication with vehicle systems." 
How do I achieve these? Give a step by step in the way they are numbered.

   - Steering: Manual or electric?
   - Throttle: Cable, potentiometer, or electronic pedal?
   - Brakes: Hydraulic, cable, or electric actuator?

2. **Plan Your DBW System**
